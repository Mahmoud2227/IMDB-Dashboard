## Features

- **Overview**: Provides an overview of IMDb data with various visualizations including distribution of movies by genre, ratings distribution, and more.
- **Content Creators**: Visualizes data related to content creators such as directors, writers, and stars. Users can explore which directors have produced the most highly-rated movies, or which writers are associated with popular TV series.
- **Parental Guide**: Displays information about parental guidance ratings, including distribution of ratings across movies and series.
- **Year**: Analyzes IMDb data based on release years, allowing users to see trends in movie and series production over time.
- **Recommendation System**: Offers a recommendation system for both movies and series. Users can select a movie or series from the dropdown menu, and the system will suggest similar titles based on content similarity. Recommendations are generated using a TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity metric applied to textual features such as description, genre, director, and more.
